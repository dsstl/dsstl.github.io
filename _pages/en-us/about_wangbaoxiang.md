**Brief introduction**: 
To address the issues of early detection difficulties, slow damage assessment, and the inability to obtain and process external environmental information in the regions affected by visual field defects in ocular diseases, a rapid detection algorithm for the defective region based on quadtree structure was developed. Additionally, a model for compensating the missing visual information based on scene danger levels and a path planning algorithm were constructed. This integrated analysis process provides visual field defect patients with a fast and accurate solution for detecting defective regions, compensating for lost visual information, and offering corresponding path planning, helping patients achieve more efficient and safer navigation in complex environments.
